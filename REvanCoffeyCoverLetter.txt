To my potential employer,

This brief cover letter is designed to give you an idea of who I am and what I have to offer to your company.  Treat this as a companion piece to my resume.

My name is Roger Coffey, but I use my middle name, Evan.  I'm 30 years old, and I live in Austin, TX with my wife and two cats.  I'm at the tail end of an education which I'm hoping will allow me to make a career transition out of the restaurant industry and into the world of web development.

For several years, I've been working as a server at various restaurants of ascendng caliber.  It's been a lot of fun, but I've been ready for a change for quite some time.  In January 2015, just a few months after arriving to Austin, I started taking classes towards an A.S. in computer science at Austin Community College (to pair with my bachelor's in music education).  I ended up finishing that degree in December 2016, but before I did, I enrolled in the Coding Boot Camp at UT Austin, which I will finish in late April 2017.

I've known for a while that I wanted to work with computers, but it wasn't until recently that I decided where my focus would be.  In the past two years, I've written code and learned how computers actually work, but my web development portfolio is, as they say, still growing.  However, what I lack in portfolio size, I make up for in drive and adaptability.

I've always loved music, and I'm a bit of a film buff, but my main focus in life right now is starting my career, by finding things to learn and problems to solve.  Please consider me for this position.

-R. Evan Coffey
